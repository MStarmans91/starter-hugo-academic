        With a joint appointment at the Radiology \& Nuclear  and Pathology departments, Martijn is heading the AI for Integrated Diagnostics (AIID) research line. The AIID group develops novel multimodal machine learning methods to develop quantitative biomarkers, focused on medical imaging and application in concology.

        * **Collaboration and awards**: Martijn is involved in various working groups and is work package leader in the Horizon 2020 EuCanImage and Horizon 2021 EOSC4Cancer projects. He is initiator and receiptient of various (consortium) grants, including an NWO NGF AINed Perfonal Fellowship (2M), the Liver AI (LAI) consortium (NWO OTP 1M grant), the Sarcoma Artificial Intelligence (SAI) consortium (Hanarth Fonds 400k grant), a Health-Holland 1M TKI grant on incidental pulmonary embolism, and project lead of the Colorectal Liver Metastes AI (COLIMA) consortium (grant submitted). In these consortia, in total 51 clinical centers, companies, professional- and patient associations from 18 countries are united. Additionally, and he is external advisor of RadioVal.
        * **MICCAI 2024 organization**: first ever Open Data Chair, initiator of the AFRICAI repository for medical imaging.
        * **Trustworthy AI**: co-lead of the FUTURE-AI guideline on trustworthy and deployable AI.
        * **Supervision**: 1 PostDoc, 9 PhD students, and 6 MSc students.

        Extending the work of his PhD, Martijn's research focused on generalization of radiomics biomarkers (conventional and deep learning based) using automated machine learning and meta-learning. He worked on a variety of clinical applications (e.g. sarcoma, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, cardiomyopathy, neuroendocrine tumors, CRPS).

        * **Management**: Co-developer of Imaging Office of department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine.
        * **Supervision**: 17 MSc students.
        * **Education**: Teaching and continuous development of three courses in the BSc and MSc Technical Medicine

      Martijn will visit the group of Prof. Dr. Karim Lekadir to collaborate on AI for
      oncology and cardiac imaging within the context of the EuCanImage and euCanSHare consortia.
      While the main focus is on developing novel algorithms for (deep) radiomics, they will 
      also work on federated learning, applying Martijn's adaptive radiomics framework from his PhD
      to ``new'' clinical applications, a second version of the FUTURE-AI [guiding principles](https://future-ai.eu/),
      and improving the clinical utility of (radiomics) AI tools.
