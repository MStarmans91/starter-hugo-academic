Martijn Starmans is a postdoctoral researcher at the Biomedical Imaging Group of the Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). His main research interest is the use of radiomics and
deep learning to improve the diagnostic work-up in oncology. To this end, he focusses on exploiting automated machine learning and meta-learning to generalize methods across applications. To evaluate this generalization, he works on a variety of clinical applications (e.g. sarcoma, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, cardiology, neuroendocrine tumors)
with various clinicians.

He successfully co-applied for a grant from the Hanarth foundation on [*AI for the grading and phenotyping of soft-tissue tumors*](https://www.hanarthfonds.nl/en/stefan-klein), and is currently co-supervising two PhD students. Through his research, he has gained ample experience with imaging infrastructure, e.g. DICOM, CTP, XNAT. As supporter of open science, he has released the software for all his studies open source (e.g. [WORC](https://github.com/MStarmans91/WORC)) and released a large [public database](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.19.21262238) of 930 patients. As recognition, he was one of the winners of the [Convergence Open Research
Awards 2021](https://www.riotsciencenl.com/award-winners).

**International collaborations**

Martijn is involved in various working groups and co-leader of the platform work package of the Horizon 2020 [EuCanImage consortium](https://eucanimage.eu/): *Towards a European cancer imaging platform for enhanced Artificial Intelligence in oncology*. In this context, he will visit the group of Prof. Dr. Karim Lekadir in the last three months of 2022. He is one of the initiators of the Sarcoma Artificial Intelligence (SAI) consortium ([grant awarded](https://www.hanarthfonds.nl/en/stefan-klein)) and the Liver Artificial Intelligence (LAI) consortium (grant submitted). In these consortia, in total 44 clinical centers, companies, professional- and patientassociations from 17 countries are united. He is also part of the Convergence flagship *Radiation Therapy Centre 2030: Personalized Self-Steering Radiotherapy* (grant submitted).

**PhD Degree**

Martijn obtained his PhD degree *''cum laude''* on February 1 2022 with his thesis titled *[Streamlined Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Development: Generalization of radiomics through automated machine learning](https://repub.eur.nl/pub/137089/thesis-MPA-Starmans-embargo-version-61c5831509bd6.pdf)*.
Following his passion to efficiently and automatically optimize routines, he developed an adaptive radiomics framework using automated machine learning, described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08618.pdf). He collaborated with a large number of clinicians to develop radiomics biomarkers in a wide
variety of clinical applications.

**Educational activities**

Martijn has co-founded two courses in the [MSc Technical Medicine](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/technical-medicine/msc-technical-medicine), which is he still teaching along. He also teaches a course in the BSc Technical Medicine. His tasks include preparing and giving lectures, developing and supervising programming sessions, and examination. He majorly enjoys working together with students and has (co-)supervised 28 students in interships and thesis projects.
