Martijn Starmans is a postdoctoral researcher at the Biomedical Imaging Group
of the Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). His main topic is on radiomics and
deep learning to improve the diagnostic work-up in oncology. To this end, he
focusses on the use of automated machine learning and meta-learning to generalize
methods and works on a variety of clinical applications. He successfully
co-applied for a grant from the Hanarth foundation
on [*AI for the grading and phenotyping of soft-tissue tumors*](https://www.hanarthfonds.nl/en/stefan-klein),
is part of the [EuCanImage consortium](https://eucanimage.eu/), and is
currently co-supervising two PhD students. As supporter of open science,
he has released the software for all his studies open source (e.g.
[WORC](https://github.com/MStarmans91/WORC)
and released a large [public database](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.19.21262238)
of 930 patients. As a result, he was one of the winners of the [Convergence Open Research
Awards 2021](https://www.riotsciencenl.com/award-winners).

**PhD Degree**

Martijn obtained his PhD degree *''cum laude''* on February 1 2022 with his thesis titled
*[Streamlined Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Development: Generalization of
radiomics through automated machine learning](https://repub.eur.nl/pub/137089/thesis-MPA-Starmans-embargo-version-61c5831509bd6.pdf)*.
Following his passion to efficiently and automatically optimize routines, he
developed an adaptive radiomics framework using automated machine learning,
described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08618.pdf). He collaborated
with a large number of clinicians to develop radiomics biomarkers in a wide
variety of clinical applications. He was also very active in education, including co-founding
two courses in the MSc Technical
Medicine study and (co-)supervising 28 students.
