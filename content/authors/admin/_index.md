Martijn Starmans is an assistant professor at the Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) leading the AI for Integrated Diagnostics (AIID) research line, with a dual appointment at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam (BIGR) (Dept. of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine) and PHANTOM group (Department of Pathology). His main research interest is the use of AI to improve the diagnostic work-up in oncology through integrated diagnostics, focussed on radiology ("radiomics") and pathology ("pathomics"). Specifically, he develops multi-modal machine learning methods to simultanously co-learn from both modalities ("radiopathomics"), and automated machine learning and meta-learning methods to generalize these methods across clinial applications. He works on a variety of clinical applications (e.g. sarcoma, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, cardiology, neuroendocrine tumors). 

**Collaborations & Consortia**
Martijn is currently part of the [MICCAI 2024](https://conferences.miccai.org/2024/en/default.asp) organization committee one of the two first ever Open Data chairs. To promote sharing of medical imaging data, he is organizing the first ever [Open Data Event](https://conferences.miccai.org/2024/en/OPEN-DATA.html) at MICCAI 2024, with a focus on underrepresented diseases and populations, with for this year special attention for African datasets. To facilitate sharing of data, he established the [AFRICAI](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10816768) repository, which other resources can use to make data FAIR.

Martijn is one of the initiators and PIs of the Sarcoma Artificial Intelligence (SAI) consortium ([grant awarded](https://www.hanarthfonds.nl/en/stefan-klein)), the Liver AI (LAI) consortium ([grant awarded](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/seven-application-oriented-projects-can-start-through-open-technology-programme)), and project lead of the Colorectal Liver Metastes AI (COLIMA) consortium (grant submitted). In these consortia, in total 51 clinical centers, companies, professional- and patient associations from 18 countries are united. He is also part of the [Trustworthy AI for MRI ICAI LAB](https://icai.ai/icai-labs/trustworthy-ai-for-mri/).

Martijn is involved in various large European projects. He is leader of the platform work package of the Horizon 2020 [EuCanImage consortium](https://eucanimage.eu/): *Towards a European cancer imaging platform for enhanced Artificial Intelligence in oncology*, and also work package leader of the  Horizon 2021 [EOSC4Cancer consortium](https://EOSC4Cancer.eu/). Additionally, he is external advisor of [RadioVal](https://radioval.eu/), and member of the AI4HI AI Development working group, and of [EUCAIM](https://EUCAIM.eu/). He has been a visiting researcher of the [BCN-AIM lab](https://www.bcn-aim.org/) of Prof. Karim Lekadir at the University of Barcelona in 2023 for 4 months.


For a better overview on his projects, see his BIGR home page: https://bigr.nl/member/martijn/. 

**PhD Degree**

Martijn obtained his PhD degree *''cum laude''* on February 1 2022 with his thesis titled *[Streamlined Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Development: Generalization of radiomics through automated machine learning](https://repub.eur.nl/pub/137089/thesis-MPA-Starmans-embargo-version-61c5831509bd6.pdf)*. Following his passion to efficiently and automatically optimize routines, he developed an adaptive radiomics framework using automated machine learning, described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08618.pdf). He collaborated with a large number of clinicians to develop radiomics biomarkers in a wide variety of clinical applications. His thesis was nominated for the Fredrik Philipsprijs 2023 for Best Dutch Radiology Thesis and [made the top five](https://radiologen.nl/system/files/bestanden/publicaties/nvvr_mr_28.1_web_pag_17.pdf).

**Educational activities**

Martijn has co-founded two courses in the [MSc Technical Medicine](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/technical-medicine/msc-technical-medicine), and is currently teaching two courses in the BSc MSC Technical Medicine and MSc Applied Physics of the TU Delft. Martijn also was part of the program committee and mentor in the first [AFRICAI Summer School](https://africai.org/summer-school/), and part of the first [Rotterdam Radiology AI course](https://www.rrai.nl/) organized by the Dutch Radiology Society. He enjoys working together with students and has so-far (co-)supervised 43 students in interships and thesis projects.
