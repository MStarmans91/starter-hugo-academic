abstract: Due to the paradigm shift in health care towards personalized medicine, there is an increased demand for biomarkers. Radiomics leverages quantitative medical imaging features and machine learning to create biomarkers based on medical imaging. While many radiomics methods have been described in the literature, these are generally designed for a single application. The overall aim of this thesis is to streamline radiomics research, facilitate its reproducibility, and simplify its application. In this thesis, we exploit recent advances in automated machine learning to develop an adaptive radiomics framework and demonstrate its use to develop radiomics biomarkers in eight different, independent clinical applications. See also [this blog](https://www.quantib.com/blog/streamlined-quantitative-imaging-biomarker-development) I wrote for one of my thesis sponsors, Quantib.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Radiomics uses quantitative medical imaging features and AI to create predictive models which can be used as biomarkers. In this thesis, we have developped an adaptive radiomics framework to automatically optimize the radiomics workflow per application and demonstrate its use to create biomarkers in eight different clinical applications.
