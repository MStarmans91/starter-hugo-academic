abstract: '<div style="text-align: justify"> AI tools in radiology are revolutionising the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients. However, there is a major gap between the large number of developed AI tools and those translated into daily clinical practice, which can be primarily attributed to limited usefulness and trust in current AI tools. Instead of technically driven development, little effort has been put into value-based development to ensure AI tools will have a clinically relevant impact on patient care. <br /> An iterative comprehensive value evaluation process covering the complete AI tool lifecycle should be part of radiology AI development. For value assessment of health technologies, health technology assessment (HTA) is an extensively used and comprehensive method. While most aspects of value covered by HTA apply to radiology AI, additional aspects, including transparency, explainability, and robustness, are unique to radiology AI and crucial in its value assessment. Additionally, value assessment should already be included early in the design stage to determine the potential impact and subsequent requirements of the AI tool. Such early assessment should be systematic, transparent, and practical to ensure all stakeholders and value aspects are considered. Hence, early value-based development by incorporating early HTA will lead to more valuable AI tools and thus facilitate translation to clinical practice. <br />  This paper advocates for the use of early value-based assessments. These assessments promote a comprehensive evaluation on how an AI tool in development can provide valuevalue in clinical practice and thus help improve the quality of these tools and the clinical process they support. </div>'
summary: 'Very proud of the first paper of PhD candidate Erik Kemper! This paper advocates for value-based development of AI tools in radiology, emphasizing that their limited clinical adoption stems from issues of usefulness and trust. By incorporating early health technology assessments (HTA) into the AI tool lifecycle, this study shows how a systematic evaluation can enhance clinical relevance and facilitate adoption into practice.'
