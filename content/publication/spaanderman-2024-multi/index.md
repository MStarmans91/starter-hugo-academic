abstract: '<div style="text-align: justify"> As differentiating between lipomas and atypical lipomatous tumors (ALTs) based on imaging is challenging and requires biopsies, radiomics has been proposed to aid the diagnosis. This study aimed to externally and prospectively validate a radiomics model differentiating between lipomas and ALTs on MRI in three large, multicenter cohorts, and extend it with automatic and minimally interactive segmentation methods to increase clinical feasibility. <br /> Three study cohorts were formed, two for external validation containing data from medical centers in the United States (US) collected from 2008 until 2018 and the United Kingdom (UK) collected from 2011 until 2017, and one for prospective validation consisting of data collected from 2020 until 2021 in the Netherlands. Patient characteristics, MDM2 amplification status, and MRI scans were collected. An automatic segmentation method was developed to segment all tumors on T1-weighted MRI scans of the validation cohorts. Segmentations were subsequently quality scored. In case of insufficient quality, an interactive segmentation method was used. Radiomics performance was evaluated for all cohorts and compared to two radiologists. <br /> The validation cohorts included 150 (54% ALT), 208 (37% ALT), and 86 patients (28% ALT) from the US, UK and NL. Of the 444 cases, 78% were automatically segmented. For 22%, interactive segmentation was necessary due to insufficient quality, with only 3% of all patients requiring manual adjustment. External validation resulted in an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.82) in US data and 0.86 (0.80, 0.92) in UK data. Prospective validation resulted in an AUC of 0.89 (0.83, 0.96). The radiomics model performed similar to the two radiologists (US: 0.79 and 0.76, UK: 0.86 and 0.86, NL: 0.82 and 0.85). <br />  The radiomics model extended with automatic and minimally interactive segmentation methods accurately differentiated between lipomas and ALTs in two large, multi-center external cohorts, and in prospective validation, performing similar to expert radiologists, possibly limiting the need for invasive diagnostics. </div>'
summary: 'Very proud of the first paper of PhD candidate Douwe Spaanderman! This study externally and prospectively validated a radiomics model for differentiating lipomas from atypical lipomatous tumors (ALTs) on MRI, incorporating automatic and minimally interactive segmentation methods to improve clinical feasibility. The model demonstrated strong diagnostic performance across three large cohorts, achieving AUCs of up to 0.89 and performing comparably to expert radiologists, potentially reducing the need for biopsies.'
