abstract: '<div style="text-align: justify"> Soft-tissue and bone tumours (STBT) are rare, diagnostically challenging lesions with variable clinical behaviours and treatment approaches. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods using radiological imaging for diagnosis and prognosis of these tumours, highlighting challenges in clinical translation, and evaluating study alignment with the Checklist for AI in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) and the FUTURE-AI international consensus guidelines for trustworthy and deployable AI to promote the clinical translation of AI methods. </div>'
summary: 'Tremendous effort of our sarcoma PhD team to review over 300 (!) papers on AI for STBT, indicating substantial gaps towards implementation in clinical practice and insights how to get there!'
