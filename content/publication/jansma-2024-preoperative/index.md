abstract: '<div style="text-align: justify"> Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft-tissue tumors prevalent in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, posing a significant risk of metastasis and recurrence. Current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging lacks decisiveness in distinguishing benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (BPNSTs) and MPNSTs, necessitating invasive biopsies. This study aims to develop a radiomics model using quantitative imaging features and machine learning to distinguish MPNSTs from BPNSTs. Clinical data and MRIs from MPNST and BPNST patients (2000–2019) were collected at a tertiary sarcoma referral center. Lesions were manually and semiautomatically segmented on MRI scans, and radiomics features were extracted using the Workflow for Optimal Radiomics Classification (WORC) algorithm, employing automated machine learning. The evaluation was conducted using a 100× random-split cross-validation. A total of 35 MPNSTs and 74 BPNSTs were included. The T1-weighted (T1w) MRI radiomics model outperformed others with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71. The incorporation of additional MRI scans did not enhance performance. Combining T1w MRI with clinical features achieved an AUC of 0.74. Experienced radiologists achieved AUCs of 0.75 and 0.66, respectively. Radiomics based on T1w MRI scans and clinical features show some ability to distinguish MPNSTs from BPNSTs, potentially aiding in the management of these tumors. </div>'
summary: 'Very proud of the first paper of PhD candidate Xinyi Wan! This study aims to improve the preoperative classification of nerve sheath tumors using radiomics, a method that extracts quantitative data from medical images. By analyzing MRI scans, we seek to develop a more accurate way to distinguish between different types of nerve sheath tumors before surgery. Our findings could lead to better treatment planning and outcomes for patients with these tumors. This research has the potential to enhance the diagnostic process and contribute to more personalized care for individuals with nerve sheath tumors, ultimately benefiting the medical community and patients alike.'
